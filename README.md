# profile.js

## This is my self version of a link's platform page, inspired in the videos of [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania). you can follow her and watch all her entire collection of apps and also watch her youtube videos to, for sure u will find something of your interest!

At the moment of the creation of the repo (29/11/2022) this page is working as a frontend proyect however the next step, once i decide the views bein complete, is create the backend server with a DB connection so everyone will be able to create an account on the site and have it's own profile page.

### [GitHub Page's link!](https://diegocoianiz.github.io/index.html)
